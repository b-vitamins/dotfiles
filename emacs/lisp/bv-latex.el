  "Compile a TeX file in a temporary directory and move the output PDF back.
This function adjusts paths in \\includegraphics commands to be absolute,
ensuring all graphics are included correctly regardless of the current working
directory.

Assumptions for successful execution:
- `org-latex-pdf-process' must be properly configured, and all commands it
  references (e.g., pdflatex, biber) must be available in the system's PATH.
- The environment for LaTeX compilation must be correctly set up, including
  necessary binaries and any dependencies specified in the LaTeX documents.
- TEXFILE provided must exist and be readable.
- The output directory specified by `bv-latex-output-dir' must be writable.
- Sufficient permissions must be granted to create and delete temporary
  directories within /tmp.

TEXFILE is the name of the file being compiled.  Processing is done through the
command specified in `org-latex-pdf-process'.  Output is redirected to
\"*Org PDF LaTeX Output*\" buffer.

When optional argument SNIPPET is non-nil, TEXFILE is a temporary file used to
preview a LaTeX snippet. In this case, simplify processing by not creating or
removing log files and skipping deletion of temporary files.

Returns the PDF file name or raises an error if it couldn't be produced. This
function is designed to be clean, not leaving any temporary files or directories
behind, regardless of the compilation's success or failure, unless processing a
snippet."
