## TASK: Process EXACTLY 10 BibTeX entries with VERIFIED DATA

**Input**: Directory path + entry range (e.g., "/home/b/projects/bibliography/tmp/neurips/2024/" entries 1-10)
**Action**: Enrich entry-1.bib through entry-10.bib (all 10) in-place
**Critical**: REAL searches required - NO hallucination/guessing allowed

## SMART BATCH PROCESSING STRATEGY

### Step 1: Scout the Conference Landing Page (if identifiable)
1. Read first entry to identify conference/year
2. TRY to fetch main proceedings page (but don't fail if it doesn't work):
   - NeurIPS might be at proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/{year}
   - ICML could be proceedings.mlr.press/v{volume}/ (volumes vary)
   - ICLR likely at openreview.net but URL structure changes
   - CVPR/ICCV pages reorganize frequently
3. If page loads successfully:
   - Extract paper titles/links you can find
   - Note URL patterns for PDFs (e.g., hash patterns)
   - Cache what's available (might be incomplete)
4. If page doesn't load or is incomplete:
   - No problem, proceed with individual searches

### Step 2: Process Each Entry with Flexible Strategy
For EACH of 10 entries:
1. Read entry-N.bib and extract title/authors
2. Check if we have cached info:
   - If yes: use it as a STARTING POINT
   - Cached URL might be partial (e.g., missing PDF hash)
   - Still need to fetch paper page for abstract
3. ALWAYS verify and complete the data:
   - Even if in cache, PDF link might need completion
   - Abstract rarely in landing page, needs paper page fetch
   - Some papers might have moved or have multiple versions
4. If NOT in cache or cache incomplete:
   - Do targeted WebSearch with what we learned
   - Use URL patterns from landing page if available
5. Write enriched entry with all verified data
6. Mark "⚠ Partial" if key data still missing

## Reality Checks for Web Scraping
- Landing pages are often incomplete or change structure
- Cached info is a HINT, not gospel - verify everything
- URLs might redirect, move, or have variants
- Abstracts almost always need individual page fetches
- PDF links often need hash completion from paper pages
- Some papers appear in multiple venues (workshop + main)
- NEVER guess if data doesn't match expectations

## Venue-Specific Proceedings URLs

### Conference Proceedings Pages (extract paper lists and URL patterns)
- **NeurIPS**: `proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/{year}` → Extract hash patterns
- **ICML**: `proceedings.mlr.press/v{volume}/` → Extract author/year patterns
  - Recent volumes: v235 (2024), v202 (2023), v162 (2022)
- **ICLR**: Search "ICLR {year} accepted papers" → Find OpenReview paper IDs
- **CVPR/ICCV**: `openaccess.thecvf.com/CVPR{year}` → Extract title/author patterns
- **ACL**: `aclanthology.org/events/acl-{year}/` → Extract paper numbers

**Smart extraction**: Don't just cache titles - learn the PDF URL construction patterns!

### Journals
- **JMLR**: jmlr.org
- **TMLR**: openreview.net/group?id=TMLR
- **IEEE TPAMI**: ieeexplore.ieee.org
- **Nature/Science**: nature.com / science.org
- **PNAS**: pnas.org
- **Neural Computation**: direct.mit.edu/neco
- **arXiv preprints**: arxiv.org (use when no venue specified)

## Fields to Enrich (ACCEPTED VERSION PRIORITY)
1. **pdf**: PDF link with strict priority order:
   - **FIRST**: Official conference proceedings PDF (camera-ready accepted version)
   - **SECOND**: Journal version if published
   - **LAST**: arXiv preprint (only if no accepted version available)
2. **url**: Official conference/journal page
3. **abstract**: From official source (proceedings > journal > OpenReview > arXiv)
4. **Missing mandatory fields**: author, title, year, booktitle/journal
5. **Optional useful fields**: pages, volume, editor, publisher

## CRITICAL: Preprint vs. Accepted Paper Distinction
**For accepted conference papers (like NeurIPS 2024):**
- ✅ **PREFER**: `proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/[HASH]-Paper-Conference.pdf`
- ❌ **AVOID**: `arxiv.org/pdf/xxxx.pdf` (this is likely the preprint)
- **Rule**: If paper appears on conference proceedings page, it's accepted → use conference PDF
- **Check pattern**: Look for conference-specific PDF URLs with official hashes

**For preprints or unpublished work:**
- Only then use arXiv links
- Mark clearly that it's a preprint if no accepted version exists

## Venue-Specific PDF Patterns (ACCEPTED VERSIONS)

### NeurIPS
- **PDF**: `proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/YEAR/file/HASH-Paper-Conference.pdf`
- **Abstract**: `proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/YEAR/hash/HASH-Abstract-Conference.html`
- **Consistency**: Use `proceedings.neurips.cc` (not `papers.nips.cc`)

### ICML
- **PDF**: `proceedings.mlr.press/vVOLUME/lastname##a/lastname##a.pdf`
- **Example**: `http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/abbas20a/abbas20a.pdf`
- **Pattern**: Volume number + author surname + year + letter suffix

### ICLR
- **PDF**: `https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PAPER_ID`
- **Example**: `https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nwDRD4AMoN`
- **Abstract**: `https://openreview.net/forum?id=PAPER_ID`

### Other Major Venues
- **CVPR/ICCV**: `openaccess.thecvf.com/content/VENUE_YEAR/papers/Author_Title_VENUE_YEAR_paper.pdf`
- **ACL**: `aclanthology.org/YEAR.venue-main.###.pdf`
- **AAAI**: Varies by year, check proceedings site

### Priority Rule
✅ Use these official patterns FIRST, only fall back to arXiv if official PDF not available

## Mandatory Fields by Type (Based on Formal BibTeX Specification)
- @article: author, title, journal, year
- @book: author OR editor, title, publisher, year
- @booklet: title
- @conference: author, title, booktitle, year (same as @inproceedings)
- @inbook: author OR editor, title, chapter OR pages, publisher, year
- @incollection: author, title, booktitle, publisher, year
- @inproceedings: author, title, booktitle, year
- @manual: title
- @mastersthesis: author, title, school, year
- @misc: (no mandatory fields, but at least one optional field should be present)
- @phdthesis: author, title, school, year
- @proceedings: title, year
- @techreport: author, title, institution, year
- @unpublished: author, title, note

## Search Tips
- Use venue-specific source FIRST (see above)
- Search: "exact title" + first author
- Verify year matches before using data

## Output Requirements for Each Entry
- Write the enriched entry back to the input file (overwrite in-place)
- Maintain proper BibTeX formatting with consistent indentation
- Include all discovered fields, not just mandatory ones
- Preserve the original entry key
- Ensure all special characters in titles/names are properly escaped
- Apply proper BibTeX grammar rules to all fields:
  - Title case protection with braces
  - Correct author name formatting
  - Proper field value encoding (quotes vs braces)
  - Balanced braces throughout
- Fix common formatting issues:
  - Convert month names to numbers
  - Use -- for page ranges
  - Format edition as ordinals
- If enrichment fails, keep the original entry unchanged in the file
- Whenever the entry has a "file" field referencing to a local PDF / filepath, ALWAYS preserve it. But never add a new file field during the enrichment process.

## Progress Tracking and Final Report
Track each entry's status as you process them:
- Success: "✓ Entry N: <entry_key> - enriched with verified data"
- Partial: "⚠ Entry N: <entry_key> - partial (specify what's missing)"
- Failed: "✗ Entry N: <entry_key> - no data found"

At the end, provide a summary report:
```
ENRICHMENT SUMMARY (10 entries processed)
------------------------------------------
Conference: NeurIPS 2024
Landing Page Attempt: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024
Landing Page Status: [Success/Partial/Failed]
Useful Patterns Found: [e.g., "PDF URLs use hash pattern", "abstracts need individual fetches"]

Successfully enriched: X entries
Partially enriched: Y entries
Failed: Z entries

Entry Status Details:
- entry-1.bib: ✓ Landing page had title match, fetched paper page for abstract
- entry-2.bib: ✓ Used landing page URL pattern + WebSearch for complete data
- entry-3.bib: ⚠ Not on landing page, found via WebSearch (workshop paper?)
[... status for all 10 entries ...]

Data Collection Method:
- Landing page provided hints: 7 entries
- Required additional search: 8 entries (for abstracts/PDFs)
- Pure WebSearch (not on landing): 3 entries
Note: Numbers overlap as most entries need multiple sources
```

## CRITICAL: Quality over Speed
- Take time to search properly for EACH entry
- Better to mark "partial" than to guess data
- Log the actual source URL you extracted data from
- If you find yourself speeding up, STOP and refocus

## Common Enrichments to Add
- Complete author list with full names
- Booktitle with full conference name
- Pages (use -- for ranges: 1234--1245)
- Volume and series for proceedings
- Publisher information
- DOI when available
- URL if no PDF available
- Month of publication (use numbers 1-12, not names)
- Editor names for collections
- ISBN/ISSN when relevant
- Edition information (use ordinals: "Second", not "2nd")
- Abstract text when available from official sources

## BibTeX Grammar Rules (Critical for Proper Formatting)

### Title Field Encoding
- **Wrong**: `title = "The LaTeX Companion"` (becomes "The latex companion" in some styles)
- **Right**: `title = "The {{\LaTeX}} {C}ompanion"` (preserves capitals and proper sorting)
- Protect acronyms and proper nouns with braces: `{NASA}`, `{HIV}`, `{BERT}`
- Special characters at brace depth 0 starting with `{\` are processed specially

### Author/Editor Name Formats
BibTeX recognizes three formats based on comma count:
1. **First von Last** (no commas): `"Donald E. Knuth"`, `"Ludwig van Beethoven"`
2. **von Last, First** (one comma): `"van Beethoven, Ludwig"`
3. **von Last, Jr, First** (two commas): `"Smith, Jr., John"`

Special cases:
- Multiple authors: `"Author One and Author Two and Author Three"`
- Et al.: `"First Author and others"`
- Capital von parts: `"{\uppercase{d}}e {\uppercase{l}}a Cruz, Maria"`
- No space after particles: `"d'\relax Ormesson, Jean"`
- Protect hyphens: `"Jean-Baptiste Poquelin"` (correctly splits to J.-B.)

### Field Value Encoding Rules
- Values can be: quoted `"..."`, braced `{...}`, or bare numbers
- Double quotes work in braced values: `title = {Comments on "Filenames"}`
- Braces must be balanced within values
- String concatenation with `#`: `author = goossens # " and " # mittelbach`
- To include unmatched braces, use `\{` or `\leftbrace`

### Common Field Format Requirements
- **Month**: Use 1-12 or standard abbreviations (jan, feb, ...), not full names
- **Pages**: Use `--` for ranges (e.g., `pages = "123--145"`), not single hyphen
- **Edition**: Use ordinals like `edition = "Second"`, not `edition = "2nd"`
- **Year**: Must be 4-digit number without quotes/braces
- **Volume/Number**: Typically only one is used, not both

### Special Entry Types
- **@string**: Define abbreviations for consistency
- **@preamble**: LaTeX commands for the bibliography
- **crossref**: Referenced entry must appear AFTER citing entries

## Common BibTeX Pitfalls to Avoid

### Name Parsing Issues
- `"jean de la fontaine"` → Parsed incorrectly (First: empty, von: "jean de la", Last: "fontaine")
- `"Jean de la fontaine"` → Still wrong (First: "Jean", von: "de la", Last: "fontaine")
- `"Jean de La Fontaine"` → Correct (First: "Jean", von: "de", Last: "La Fontaine")

### Title Casing Problems
- Unprotected capitals will be lowercased by some styles
- LaTeX commands need double braces: `{{\LaTeX}}` not `{\LaTeX}`
- Protect entire acronyms: `{NASA}` not `N{A}S{A}`

### Field Validation Warnings
- Check for lowercase words that might incorrectly become von parts
- Verify special characters in names are properly encoded
- Ensure mathematical expressions in titles are in math mode
- Validate that URLs and DOIs are properly formatted
- Check that institutional names don't get parsed as person names

### Quality Indicators
- Prefer complete first names over initials when available
- Include all authors (avoid premature "and others")
- Use official venue names, not abbreviations
- Add series information for conference proceedings
- Include both ISBN and ISSN when applicable

## FINAL REMINDERS
- You MUST process EXACTLY 10 entries, no more, no less
- You MUST perform REAL searches for EACH entry
- You MUST NOT hallucinate or guess any data
- You MUST modify each file in-place (overwrite the original)
- You MUST provide source verification for each entry
- FAILURE TO VERIFY DATA IS A CRITICAL ERROR

Remember: Data quality and verification are MORE important than speed. It's better to process 10 entries correctly with real data than to rush through and introduce false information.
