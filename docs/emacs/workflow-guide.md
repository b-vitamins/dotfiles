## Common Emacs Anti-patterns

### Inefficient File Access

Instead of:
```
C-x C-f, type full path every time
```
Do:
```
Use recent files, project files, or consult-find
```

Instead of:
```
Opening dired, navigating, then finding files
```
Do:
```
Direct file access with completion
```

Instead of:
```
Bookmarking every frequently accessed location
```
Do:
```
Let the system learn your patterns automatically
```

### Poor Buffer Management

Instead of:
```
Accumulating hundreds of open buffers
```
Do:
```
Use project-kill-buffers and selective buffer closing
```

Instead of:
```
Manually typing buffer names
```
Do:
```
Use pattern matching in buffer selection
```

Instead of:
```
Getting lost in buffer lists
```
Do:
```
Use grouping and filtering in buffer selection
```

### Suboptimal Search Patterns

Instead of:
```
Using basic isearch for everything
```
Do:
```
Choose appropriate search tool: consult-line, consult-ripgrep, etc.
```

Instead of:
```
grep without context or preview
```
Do:
```
Use consult tools with live preview
```

Instead of:
```
Searching in wrong scope (buffer vs project vs global)
```
Do:
```
Use scope-appropriate search commands
```

### Ineffective Completion Usage

Instead of:
```
Typing full command names
```
Do:
```
Use abbreviations with orderless completion
```

Instead of:
```
Tab-completing through long lists
```
Do:
```
Type distinctive patterns to narrow quickly
```

Instead of:
```
Ignoring completion documentation
```
Do:
```
Read the rich context provided by corfu/marginalia
```

### Manual Workflows That Should Be Automated

Instead of:
```
Manually saving and compiling code
```
Do:
```
Set up automatic compilation on save
```

Instead of:
```
Manual backup file management
```
Do:
```
Configure automatic backup handling
```

Instead of:
```
Repetitive text insertion
```
Do:
```
Create yasnippet templates or tempel snippets
```

Instead of:
```
Manual project setup for each language
```
Do:
```
Use dir-locals or project-specific configuration
```

### Poor Git Integration

Instead of:
```
Switching between Emacs and terminal for git
```
Do:
```
Use magit for all git operations
```

Instead of:
```
Manual merge conflict resolution
```
Do:
```
Use magit + smerge for visual conflict resolution
```

Instead of:
```
Forgetting to check git status before committing
```
Do:
```
Use magit-status as your git home base
```

### Org-mode Underutilization

Instead of:
```
Using org-mode just as a text format
```
Do:
```
Leverage agenda, capture, and linking features
```

Instead of:
```
Separate tools for notes, tasks, and scheduling
```
Do:
```
Integrate everything through org-mode ecosystem
```

Instead of:
```
Manual linking between related notes
```
Do:
```
Use org-roam for automatic relationship tracking
```

### Window Management Issues

Instead of:
```
Using mouse for window operations
```
Do:
```
Learn keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
```

Instead of:
```
Manually arranging windows every session
```
Do:
```
Use winner-mode to save/restore layouts
```

Instead of:
```
Working in single window all the time
```
Do:
```
Use multiple windows/frames for context
```

## Advanced Workflow Compositions

### Research Paper Workflow

Instead of:
```
Separate tools for reading, note-taking, and writing
```
Do:
```
org-roam â†’ citar â†’ org-latex â†’ org-export pipeline

```
Do:
```

```
Do:
```

```
Do:
```
project-mode + eglot + magit + compilation integration
```

Instead of:
```
Manual project switching overhead
```
Do:
```
perspective-mode + project integration
```

Instead of:
```
Separate debugging setup
```
Do:
```
dape integration with project and language modes
```

### Daily Knowledge Work

Instead of:
```
Scattered task management across tools
```
Do:
```
org-agenda + org-capture + org-roam integration
```

Instead of:
```
Manual daily note creation
```
Do:
```
org-roam-dailies with template automation
```

```

## Diagnostic and Optimization

### Performance Troubleshooting

Instead of:
```
Wondering why Emacs is slow
```
Do:
```
profiler-start, reproduce issue, profiler-report
```

Instead of:
```
Guessing which package causes problems
```
Do:
```
Use built-in debugging and profiling tools
```

### Configuration Issues

Instead of:
```
Editing init file directly
```
Do:
```
Understand the modular configuration system
```

Instead of:
```
Adding random configurations found online
```
Do:
```
Follow the established configuration patterns
```

Instead of:
```
Ignoring package loading errors
```
Do:
```
Check *Messages* buffer for diagnostic information
```

### Learning and Discovery

Instead of:
```
Memorizing all possible commands
```
Do:
```
Use which-key to discover available options
```

Instead of:
```
Random key mashing to find features
```
Do:
```
Use describe-key (C-h k) and describe-function (C-h f)
```

Instead of:
```
Asking others for every small thing
```
Do:
```
Use built-in help system and apropos commands
```

This workflow guide demonstrates how the carefully configured Emacs environment provides powerful, integrated workflows that eliminate context switching and manual overhead. The key is learning to trust the completion system, use appropriate search scopes, and leverage the rich integration between different tools rather than fighting against the configuration or falling back to external tools.
